# Global Setup

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/web-application-testing/test-database/optimizing-test-setup/solution" />

👨‍💼 With this global setup, we have a base database that is based on our schema
and has the critical seed data we need for our tests to run. You've done a
spectacular job and I think you should be proud of yourself. 👏👏

	The Epic Stack goes further by copying over the test database for each test
	individually which keeps each test completely isolated. Feel free to check it
	out here:
